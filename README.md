High fidelity prototype for E-Warung


## Product Summary

### Problem Space

Small and medium scale food vendor tends to have a hard time competing with large restaurants and modern food franchises. One of the main reasons why large restaurants have the edge over small vendors is the use of digital marketing which makes it easier to be accessed by people. Meanwhile, small and medium vendors do not have the resources to do such thing. Based on this problem, we try to close the distance between consumer and small scale vendor by providing a platform where prospective buyers can access information about vendors and the menus that they provide via online.

### Concept and Design Description

The system that we are providing are built in form of a mobile application. The design of this application resembles that of a catalogue or a list of menus on which consumers can choose which cuisine they wish to order. The menu on the  lists itself are compiled from cuisines served by various vendors enlisted to the system. In addition to that, consumers are also given a choice to order fried rice on their own special preferences.

When an order is placed, the system will send the order to the “warung” of providing vendor. If the respective vendor has more than one “dapur”, the system will automatically calculate and choose the nearest “dapur” from consumer’s location. “Dapur” manager have privileges to approve or decline incoming order, while consumer has a choice to cancel an order while it is not yet approved by manager. Both party will be notified of the other’s action towards the order. The delivery procedure of each order are handled entirely to “dapur” management. Consumer can track through each state of their order. When the order arrived, consumer should confirm the “order complete” state on the system. Otherwise, the confirmation must be made manually by respective “dapur” manager.
